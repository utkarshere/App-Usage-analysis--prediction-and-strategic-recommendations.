# App-Usage-analysis-through-ML
 Project involving analysis of user application interaction time and quitting reasons through advanced analytics and generating pricing and retention strategy recommendations.

# Problem Statement and approach

In this simple pet project, a dataset containing 10000 records of customer engagement metrics with an application has been analyzed where the key fields include number of days utilized, number of minutes spent on the application, along with the four different reasons of quitting the application. Alongside these crucial fields, customers are also offered a range of pricing for the application which is another field. Classification models like randomforestclassifier and logistic regression model are trained and tested to achieve an approximate accuracy of 67%. Furthermore, K-means clustering algorithm is used to segregate consumers into appropriate cluster based on their usage traits. In addition, visualization depicting key insights are also presented along with pricing and retention strategies for increasing customer engagement as well as revenue. 

## UPDATE :
A new analysis involving building a classification model and recommending the highest price a customer wil accept at two probability thresholds. If no such price exists, the original or minimum price is recommended.
